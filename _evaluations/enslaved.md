“Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade” is a digital project begun in 2018. Through the funding and efforts of the Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, MATRIX, Michigan State University, the University of Maryland, and UC Riverside, this project seeks to serve as a digital repository wherein “scholars, genealogists, students, and members of the public” may readily access information and data pertaining to the historical slave trade, those involved in its perpetuation, and those affected by enslavement.

This project’s strength lies in the manner by which its vast information is available and organized for users. The website itself permits users to search for individuals, events, and places of significance to the slave trade—allowing for extensive filtering based on an individual’s gender, age, ethnic background, role in the slave trade, occupation, or status (enslaved, owner, freed, etc.) in regards to individuals, for example. This website provides easy access to those sources through which this website is able to document those individuals, events, and places that are included throughout. These sources are crucial in the realization of this project’s hope to provide highly detailed stories of the brutal experiences and circumstances enslaved people were subject to.

This project answers important questions pertaining to the roles and processes involved in the maintenance and persistence of the slave trade across centuries. The inclusion of all those involved in the slave trade allows for greater insight into the structures in place to support the slave trade’s persistence, and thus its overreaching effect on millions of lives around the world. It may serve to provide greater geographic and historical context for the slave trade, particularly in regards to the geographic boundaries of the slave trade, the economics of this highly profitable and exploitative industry, and much more.

I do think this website is more useful if you know exactly what it is that you are researching and seeking to learn about the slave trade. I felt it was not too welcoming to those simply wanting to learn about these issues. While it did feature several individuals, events, and places of significance, this amount was not extensive. You would have to search across the website’s vast repository of knowledge to find more details in these areas—which I feel scholars with specific questions searching for specific answers would have a more feasible time doing.
