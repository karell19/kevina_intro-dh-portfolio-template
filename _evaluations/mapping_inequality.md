### Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America

Mapping Inequality is a Geographic Information Systems project developed with the hope of bringing to light the ways in which government officials, lenders, and real estate interests propogated the effects of racial and class segregation in cities and communities across the United States through federal housing policy. Developed by three teams across four universities, this project provides easily-accessible and digitized content pertaining to the methods through which the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) evaluated neighborhoods based on details such as quality of housing, sale and renting values, and racial and ethnic identity and class. In this way, this project also serves as a Digital Repository of sorts. Users may access, free-of-charge, digitized copies of those original documents produced by HOLC close to its inception per the New Deal.

This project is grounded on data derived from HOLC's notorious City Survey project, which ran from 1935-1940, resulting in the mapping of "mortgage security" of neighborhoods in the country. To do this, it relies on GeoJSON files and Shapefiles to display the original HOLC maps in a geographically accurate format, and uses an ArcGIS Toolbox and a Python script to further, display those boundaries between the neighborhoods HOLC defined and classified. 

Overall, it allows users to closely interact with these detailed maps, to learn about the classification of neighborhoods per HOLC's "mortgage security" standards, and to learn about the reasons as to why such classification was decided. Collections of texts are included that highlight the racist language those involved in the making of these HOLC maps used to describe neighborhoods. One of its greatest, most impactful strengths, is the way it places into perspective how deeply-ingrained racism, classism, and xenophobic beliefs have, and continue to, hinder families and communities. 

This project could benefit from including information about how these mapped neighborhoods stand in the present day, relative to when these HOLC categorizations were originally made. It could show demographic or economic changes over time, so as to provide insight into the true-scale that redlining had across communities over generations. While it may involve time-consuming and challenging geographic and demographic analysism, such efforts may also lead to pushes for reparations for those most impacted and hindered by the results of such government-funded segregation policies.
