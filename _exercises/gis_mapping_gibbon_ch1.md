# Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter 01 GIS Mapping

My GIS Mapping of Chapter 01 from Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" can be accessed at: https://arcg.is/irijv0

This map sets locations, as named by Gibbon using their historical aliases, with respect to the location they represent on a map, as we know them in the present day. Further, it utilizes mapping data that emplaces boundaries based on postcode for Italy and Greece--two important centers of the Roman Empire.
