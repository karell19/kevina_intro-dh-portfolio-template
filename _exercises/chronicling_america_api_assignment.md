## Chronicling America API Assignment
Kevin Arellano Flores

CLS-0161 -- Introduction to Digital Humanities

Dr. Saxton

## Tasks:
In this assignment, you are tasked with:
* searching Chronicling America's API for a key word of your choice
* parsing your results from a dictionary to a `DataFrame` with headings "title", "city", 'date", and "raw_text"
* processing the raw text by removing "\n" characters, stopwords, and then lemmatizing the raw text before adding it to a new column called "lemmas."
* saving your `DataFrame` to a csv file

If you need any help with this assignment please email micah.saxton@tufts.edu

Md., are pretty fast when it comes to catching\nfrogs on the Eastern Shore (see page 7); but it wasn’t\ntoo many years ago that they were speedy in another\nsport: Racing boats. They are members of the Gulf\nMarine Hall of Fame. Earle broke the world mile record\nin a homemade Pacific One-Design hydroplane In 1939.\nEd bought Earle’s boat and 10 years later was admitted\nto the hall for winning 18 out of 21 starts in 5-mlle races.\nHOW-TO-DO-IT YOURSELF: While Earle still had the\nboat—which had to be raced without any change in\ndesign—he figured the only way he could gain advantage\nover other drivers was through weight. He went to a\nBaltimore lumber yard and weighed every piece of\nmahogany he came upon until he had selected enough\nlightweight wood for his craft. He managed to lower\nthe boat’s weight considerably.\n“SEE-SAW” SEED: Washington’s see-saw circuit (see page\n12) is getting a preview of the program Erika Thlmey\nwill take to Tufts University on August 20.

You\'re only guessing I Here, fully authenticated, are the answers\n1. True. Men are better at reducing. Weight\nreduction studies conducted by the University of\nPennsylvania School of Medicine and the Depart\nment of Nutrition at New York Hospital show that\nmales tend to be far more successful than females\nin losing excess poundage. And the more excess\navoirdupois involved, the more the men outdistance\nthe women in shedding it.\nW hy? Science is stopped cold here.\n2. True. Wen make better jurors than women.\nRecent studies conducted by the School of the\nUniversity of Chicago show that male jurors partici\npate more actively and effectively in jury delibera\ntions than female jurors. Women jurors were found\nto spend more time exchanging personal experi\nences and making disruptive remarks. Men tended\nto show greater competence in objectively reviewing\nand evaluating trial evidence.\n3. True. Women are taps at “girl-watching."\nResearchers have found that men don’t spend nearly\nas much of their time eyeing pretty girls as women\ndo. In studies conducted at Harvard, for example,\nwhen movies were shown to groups of men and\nwomen subjects (in situations where their eye move\nments could be observed) it was found that women\nspent more time than men watching the heroine.\nOther studies have noted that when a woman joins\na party, she almost invariably takes stock of all the\nwomen present before she even looks at the men.\n4. Folse. Wen do not enjoy meeting new people\nas much as women do. Sociological studies con\nducted at Tufts University show that women like\nthe society of other people much more.\nMen were found more inclined to take an anti\nsocial attitude toward their environment, and to be\nmore wary of relationships with others. Women\nwere more inclined to regard the world as being\npleasant, friendly and sociable.\n6. True. Women are better judges of human\nnature.

It would seem as\nthough they actually charged us with,\nshooting our own people though\nthere has not been an arrest of a\nstriker on the charge of carrying\nconcealed weapons.\nAfter the meeting Hillman told a\nDay Book man that he asked a Trib\nune reporter if that paper will print a\nlist of strikers and friends of Btrikers\nwho are victims of police violence\nand rough work of sluggers. Hill\nman now has the names of over 1,000\noi these cases and said that when\nfinished is may run close to 2,000.\nThe Tribune slips into a news story\ntoday in italics one important fact\nnot put to the front at all when it\nprinted Schuettler\'s list Saturday.\n"The list was alleged by the police\nto include ALL victims of violence,\nwhether strikers, strikebreakers or\nnon-combatants," says the Trib edi\ntor.

To\nanswer all those kind inquiries, it\nit because I have had little of im\nportance to say, and I have always\nbelieved that it is not my function\nto fill up space with trivia. When\nI do have something to say I will\nsay it.\nLast week, for example, I re\nceived in the mail a package for\nthe staff of the News Review. It\nwas a box of candy, and with it\nwas a card which read, “We have\nalways appreciated the newspaper.”\nNow incidents like this are all too\nrare. In fact, we are normally on\nthe receiving end of an incredible\namount of abuse, and it is with\nsincere gratitude that we accept\nthis token from a faithful reader.\nIt helps us to renew our deter\nmination to do the best job of\nreporting and reviewing local\nevents that we can, as our con\ntribution to community life. In\nthis respect, we also renew our\nperennial plea to those residents\nwhose interests and talents lie\nalong similar lines. We can al\nways use more reporters, copy\nreaders, proofreaders and clerical\n\'workers on the paper. There is,\nof course, no money involved, but\nI doubt that anyone could find a\nmore satisfying or rewarding way\nto spend two or three hours each\nweek.

I cannot draw con\nclusions concerning the Ibcal situa\ntion from the scanty information\nfurnished in your paper. May I,\nhowever, present some basic ques\ntions which badly need public\nanswer if we are to get at the real\ncauses of the alleged discipline\nproblem at the junior high school?\nFirst of all, who are the trouble\nmakers ? Apparently they represent\nonly a small minority of the total\nstudent body. What is known of\nthis small group’s mental maturity?\nOf their emotional development?\nHave they physical defects and ab\nnormalities? What is known of\ntheir home situations?\nSecondly, when seriously distur\nbed children appear in the schools\nof Prince Georges county, what\nfacilities, if any, are available to\nthe faculty for diagnosis and treat\nment of these children?\nIf there are no such facilities, or\nif they are very limited, with the\nmajor job of dealing with these\nchildren left to the ordinary class\nroom teacher, then we must be\nconcerned with the number of other\nresponsibilities laid upon that teach\ner. How heavy is his teaching\nload; that is, how many classes\ndoes he teach per week? How many\npupils does he have per class? How\nmany other activities outside the\nclassroom is he responsible for?\nIs he relieved of minor but time\nconsuming clerical duties by the\npresence of a paid secretary? It\ngoes without saying that the educa\ntion, training, and experience of\nthe individual teachers is of para\nmount importance.\nFourthly, if severly maladjusted\nchildren must be handled in regu\nlar classes, what attempt is made\nto provide the best possible condi\ntions? For example, is the average\nclass size kept reasonably small?\nAre the rooms appropriate for\nteaching ?\nSome concern with finding ans\nwers to these questions might prove\nmore useful to all those concerned\nthan a continuing dispair over\nserious and unpleasant symptoms.\nSincerely,\nVirginia W. Beauchamp\nThe Long View\nBy A1 Long\nNow that election day is over\nLosing candidates can glare and\nglower\nAnd view us all with a suspicious\nlook\nNot knowing exactly who gave them\nthe hook.\ni\nBut the winners too have trouble\nahead\nAnd will often be called from an\nearly bSd\nTo explain taxes, and issues, and\nthe water rate\nTo a great many of us in the elec\ntorate.\nAnd the thing that amuses me\nmost of all\nIs the demanding citizen with the\ngreatest gall\nIn pushing an idea to which he is\nmost devoted\nIs usually that character who never\neven voted!\n1 Greenbelt Homes, Inc. f\n| CONSULT YOUR REAL ESTATE OFFICE |\n| Located at Ridge and Hamilton Place To Buy and Sell Your Corporation\n| Homes. |\n» Licensed and Bonded Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen Will Serve You »\n1 Fee only V/ 2 % |\n® Open For Sales 7 Days A Week |\n| GR 3-4161 GR 3-2781 |\nRecreation Classes\nA variety of recreation classes\nfor children will be offered in the\nCounty Recreation Department’s\nfall program at sixteen schools\nthroughout the County.

      'raw_text': "Page Ten\n*Jewish Food ’ Strange\nTo Gourmets Os Israel\nJERUSALEM While conservative dishes such\nas roast chicken, mashed potatoes and peas still rank\nhigh on the menus of most fashionable hotels and\nrestaurants in Israel, more and more Israelis are de\nveloping a craving for exotic foods and are beginning\nto look for that little “extra something” in a good\nmeal.\nAside from oriental restaurants, which can be\nfound on every main street of Israel’s cities, specializ\ning in spicy salads and meats grilled on skewers,\nsmaller restaurants situated mainly in suburbs and\nimmigrant towns serve authentic Balkan, Rumanian,\nFrench and oriental dishes as well as various “spe\ncialities de la maison.”\nThe sophisticated tourist, however, may complain\nthat Tel Aviv cannot boast of such a wealth of cuisines\nas can be found in Paris or in New York. But he will\nhave to admit that progress is very rapid. You can\nnow get in Tel Aviv a real Neapolitan pizza as well\nas the Israeli version of chop suey.\nSOME AMERICAN tourists are surprised that\nonly a few Israeli restaurants serve “Jewish Food.”\nActually these tourists are mistaken. What they are\nlooking for is Eastern European cooking, which is\nstranger to Israelis from Oriental countries than to\nGentiles in America.\nThus, gefilte fish, kreplach and stuffed derma\nhave no more of a chance of becoming national dishes\nthan have the spicy and oily Yemenite foods, the sweet\nbaked carp appreciated by the Poles or the apple pie\nwhich the American settlers brought with them.\nDoes that mean that Israel in her ten years of\nindependence has not developed a national dish yet.\nWell, not really. Israeli legations abroad, when asked\nby editors of women’s magazines to contribute recipes\nof national dishes, usually describe the secrets of mak\ning falafel. But although these balls of hot chick-peas,\nfried in deep oil, enjoy a tremendous popularity, they\nare not really a “dish.” Like pop-corn, hot chestnuts\nand hot dogs, falafel is not ordered in restaurants but\nbought on the street.\nFalafel is believed to be most appealing when\npurchased from a somewhat unsavory vendor at a\nstreet corner. Many Israelis suspect than when the\npresent clean-up drive is completed and health regula\ntions are strictly enforced, falafel will never taste the\nsame again...\nOrganizational Activities\nfiß Women\nThe next regular board\nmeeting of B’nai B’rith Wom\nen, Chapter 613, will be held\nJuly 10 at 10 a.m. at the\nHillel building.

Dr. Kauth explains, is not named after j\nthe month. It is a fracture of the bone just behind the second toe.\nOriginally discovered in soldiers\nwho do a lot of marching, podia\ntrists now find it occurring most\nfrequently in women and caused\nby prolonged wearing of high\nheels. Its incidence is higher in\nMarch when women buy their\nfirst pair of new Spring shoes.\nAnd its prevention is simple;\nChoose low heels—2 to 2-Vi\ninches high—for shoes that\nyou\'ll be walking in.\nMarch fractures. Dr. Kauth\nsays, aren’t the only foot ailment\nto look out for in March. Feet\nalso are prone to swell this time\nof the year, like the buds.\nY \\ I\nf H echt j ®r »sss«!RFE!BSft!Kir a&mg\n\\ pQ J GUARANTEED SAVINGS OF 20% OR MORE ON ADVERTISED ITEMS!\nDECORATOR FOAM SOFAS & CHAIRS\n• * *■\n■■■ ■. r —- f 1 —~n\nROWE 6-PC.

The way to find out :\nwhether or not you fall in this\nclass is to buy your shoes afterl\na hard day’s work or shopping.\nIf your feet are the swelling\n, kind, they’ll be swollen then.\nBe sure, too, he says, to get\n\' shoes that are leather all the\n-way through; soles as well as\n; uppers. Leather, with its net\nwork of tiny pores, allows mois-\nture to evaporate and thus\'\nreduces the danger of swelling.\nDr. Kauth also has these bits\nof timely advice:\nDon\'t wear your new shoes\nevery day. Shoes that have been!\nworn six or eight hours need a\nday’s airing before you don\nthem again.\nAnd, to give your feet & spring\n.tonic, get a shampoo spray and\nwith it spray your feet for two\nminutes with hot water, one\nwith cold. Do this for 10 min\niutes.\nUse a shoe horn to put your\nI shoes on. It will help them re-:\ntain their shape and prevent!\npossible slipping up and down\non the heel.\n1 \'\nDoctors Paged Quietly\nLONDON.—Doctors in St.\nThomas’ Hospital in London arc\nbeing paged these days by means\nof a transistor radio receiver\nthat clips to a pocket like a pen.\nEliminated are corridor loud\nspeakers, bells and flashing\nlights. 1\n|*■ •; ** v* -**.•,. ■■■■k-A•:*■>&-At- <4\n—Slinkman Photographers\nGOLDEN FETE— Mr. and\ni Mrs. Joseph McCulloch of\nNorth Beach, Md., will\ncelebrate their 50th wed\nding anniversary with a\n1 reception at the Union\nChurch Hall at North\nBeach on Saturday.

Defense\nMEDFORD, Mass, Mar. 27\nf/P).—Do you know Just when\nyou fell asleep last night? Os\ncourse you don’t.\nBelieve it or not—scientists\nworry about things like that. A\nperson never knows exactly when\nhe dozes off. Furthermore, Tufts\nUniversity psychologists will tell\nyou that the smartest scientist\nin the world can’t tell—even;\nwhen he’s watching you—the\nprecise moment when you cease\n|to be awake.\n| One might think that solving;\na problem like that—finding out\'\naway to tell exactly when a per\nson is no longer awake—would\nnot be important to national\ndefense. But it is. The Army\'s’\nQuartermaster Corps, which\nconducts research into military\nequipment, needs to know. Why? 1\nTo test the efficiency of sleeping 1\nbags.\nIn these days of long-range\nbombers and nuclear weapons,\nwhen the arctic regions are of\ngrowing strategic importance,\nthe alertness of one man, or a\nsmall group of men, could play\na vital role in w’ar. Inefficient\nsleeping bags may cause men to\nbe sleepy when they should be\n’ alert.\nTest for Sleeping Bags\n1 Dr. Paul D. Coleman and asso\nciates in the Tufts Institute for\nApplied Experimental Psychol\nogy are trying to develop equip\nment and a technique which the\nQuartermaster Corps can use to\ntest its sleeping bags. They hope\nthe sleeping-testing gear will de\ntect the moment a subject falls\nto sleep and also show how well\nhe. sleeps during the night.\nThe project has the imposing\nTHE EVENING STAR, Washington, D. C.\nWEDNESDAY. MARCH S7.HIS7\nname “Electroencephalographic\nCorrelates of Sleep.” In simple\nwords, it’s a study of the corre\nlation of brain waves and sleep.\nAll human brains generate tiny\nelectric currents. Dr. Coleman is\nstudying these brain waves for\nclues to show just when you fall\nasleep and evidence of how deep\nly you sleep.\nj Since this is a study of sleep\nitself, the students who volunteer\nto advance science by sleeping\ndon’t sleep in sleeping bags. They\nrelax on a special bed in a room\ninsulated not only against sound,\nbut also against all stray electri\ncal currents. The little room is\ncompletely inclosed in an elec\ntrically grounded copper mesh.\nBecause the brain currents are\nso tiny any stray electricity from\noutside could disturb readings.\nWiggles Slow Down\n1 Research already shows that\nthe little wiggles in the line*\ntraced by the brain wave record\ning machine become slower as\nthe subject sinks into sleep. It\nalso appears that there are up\nand-down stages in sleeping: we\nseem to sleep in irregular cycles,\nsometimes deeply, then lightly.\nIn an attempt to find that\nelusive moment when conscious\nness ends and sleep begins, the\npsychologists have set up a loud\nspeaker in the sleeping room.\nThe subject holds a buttoft\nattached to an electric cord.\nEach time he hears a sound from\nthe speaker, he responds by\npressing the button. Gradually,\nthe responses show an increas\ning lag. When the responses\ncease entirely, the subject is\nclearly asleep.\nThe psychologists say they\nhope they\'ll find out how dreams\naffect sleep—but they hold out\nI no hope of telling what tha\nsleeper is dreaming about.\nA-19'},

The fabrics, woven on\nlooms in the home, are richly\nembroidered with geometrical,\nplant and figure designs.\nThe hand woven carpets\nof Romania have long earned\nrespect for their craftsmen.\nThe carpet weaver inherits an\n“ornamental grammar” whose\nmost abstract geometrical\nforms have a precise meaning\nsuch as “Daybreak” and “Tree\nof Life.”\nRomanian ceramics reflect\nthe elegant shapes of the\nGreco-Roman tradition, re\ncalling the days when Ro\nmania’s territory was a Ro\nman province.\nIncluded in the exhibition\nare examples of the great var\niety of musical instruments\nused by the Romanians to\nplay their folk music.\nIn introducing the exhibi\ntion, Dr. Harry L. Shapiro\nof the American Museum of\nNatural History states: “The\nRomanian examples in the\ncurrent exhibition are parti\ncularly precious both because\nthey come from one of the\ngreat folk arts and also be\ncause their survival to our\nday allows us to see the full\nextent of such an art.”\nMother Thank you so\nmuch for keeping Jean over\nthe week end.

Eastman soon\nmay issue a second order, defi\nnitely banning extended travel\nby the baseball clubs during the\nSpring season; 2—That Commis\nsioner K. M. Landis will call a\njoint Major League meeting to\nstudy the situation.\nLandis couldn’t be reached in\nChicago, his home declaring\nonly that he was “on a train”\nbut refusing to give his destina\ntion.\nWilliam Harridge, president of\nthe Amercian League, also could\nnot be reached but his Chicago\noffice released a statement\nwhich said in part that “nothing\ncan be done until the Spring\ntraining programs are straight\nened out. If the clubs believe\nthey can train at home there’s a\npossibility that the opening of\nthe season (now set for April\n13) may be delayed a couple of\nweeks.” *\nTwo requests from National\nBowling Scores\nHOLY NAME LEAGUE\nMt.

Al\'Gl\'ST S«, 19A7\n\'Egghead\' Label Called\nWrong for Independent\nThe Independent voter—commonly thought to be the "egg\nhead” in American society—is not an intellectual, two sociologists\nsaid here today.\nProfessors Edward M. Bennett and Harriet M. Goodwin, of\nTufts University, in a paper delivered today at the 52d annual\nmeeting of the American Sociological Society at the Shoreham\nHotel, drew these distinctions\nbetween Republican, Demo\ncratic and independent voters:\nThe Democratic Party is\nmore emotionally uncontrolled.\nIt is felt to be capable of wider\nswings both toward aggression\nand benevolence. But because\nof its tendency to avoid the\nmiddle of the road, there also is\nthe feeling that the party is\nsocially improper.\nG. O. P. “Contral” Seen\nThe Republican Party is\nmore emotionally controlled.\nIn an abstract sense, it seems\nto show less of the "Freudian i\nerotic" need to construct, love,\nand integrate, and less of the\n“thanatoc need" to destroy, l\naggress and attack.\nThe independents are prob\nably not as close to the body\npolitic. They do not appear to\nbe the political critics, nor are\nthey the boosters. They are,\nnot the intellectuals, nor are\nthey overly emotional. They\nmerely seem to be apart froim\na community they feel to be\nslightly unfriendly.\nData for the study was de\nrived from an assessment of\n384 Great Boston housewives\nbetween October. 1955, and\nMay. 1956\nBoth Republicans and Dem\nocrats. the sociologists said,\nvoted for the party\'s presiden\ntial candidate in the elections ,\nof 1944, 1948 and 1952. The in\ndependent group split their vote\nbetween the two major parties\n—voting once for one party and\ntwice for the other.\nSocial Concern Cited\nThe sociologists described the\nDemocratic and Republican\nwomen as differing “in away\nwe might think* of as tender\nminded as opposed to tough\nminded.”\nFor example, they said, the\nFew Children\nOs Divorcees\nFelt Conflict\nA University of California\nsociologist said today that—\ncontrary to previous assump\ntions—children whose parent?\nlater were divorced felt their\nhome life was quite satisfactory.\nJudson T. Landis told the\nAmerican Sociological Associ\nation. meeting at the Shore\nham Hotel, of a study of 330\nUniversity of California stu\ndents whose parents were di\nvorced.\n“It is often assumed,” he said,\naccording to an Associated\nPress report, “that divorce is\nalmost always preceded by\ngreat unhappiness and open\nconflict, and yet the findings\nbring out rather clearly that\nfrom the point of view of the\nchild the home may be quite\nsatisfactory."\nHe said only 22 per cent of\nthe children who could remem\nber their homes before they\n\'learned of the possible divorce\nreported open conflict between\nparents.\nHowever. Mr. Landis said,\nwhen divorce plans were made\nknown "the experience was\nmore severe for the child who\nbelieved his was a happy home.”\nHe said 41 per cent "couldn’t\nbelieve that it had happened to\nus."\nmay** :* mm& mtmimmgtmmm ■■ ■ mmsmmm\n0 Family plans for a new home, college\nfor the children, maybe travel ... are more\nthan promises.

They seem\n; more concerned with the social\nnature of life in general, and\nwith the social purposes of\npolitical parties in specific.\nThe Republican women, their\nstudy indicated, have a more\nself-oriented approach both to\nthemselves and to their party.\nThey seem to have greater self\nconfidence and awareness of\ntheir own capacity and effi\nciency.\nBut. the sociologists said, the\nRepublicans “seem little con\ncerned with the purposes be\nhind their high efficiency. In\nfact, they seem to <o out of\ntheir way to stress the value\nof their party being materialis\ntic and som-whnt socially de\ntached."\nHie independents, it was\nstated, “seem the least benev\nolent in their attitudes towards\nother people. They see others\nin a relatively unattractive\nlight.”\nIn addition, the sociologists\nsaid, the independets “see\nothers as potentially dangerous\n;to themselves.

Unable to join the Israeli army,\nthey volunteered as medical aides in a civilian hospital near the\nUniversity at Ramat Gan. They drove ambulances, rolled bandages,\nworked in the chemistry laboratories and helped move the wounded\nsoldiers from army trucks directly to emergency operating rooms.\nOne night, they labored from sunset to dawn, their hands covered\nwith blood, their hearts full of pain for the suffering they witnessed.\nOne student wrote home, "I saw 17 and 18 year old boys who could\nhave been on football teams. I also saw 40 and 45 year old family\nmen, many badly wounded, some dying. It was then I fell my rela\ntions with Israel were very close—and these were my brothers."\nAbove, three Bar-Ilan students are pictured wheeling a wounded\nsoldier into an operating room. From left to right, they are: Ranon\nKatzoff of Chicago, David Salzman and Daniel Kirshblum of Brook\nlyn, New York.\nPeace at Israels Expense Proposed\nBY MILTON FRIEDMAN\n(Copyright, 1956, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Inc.)\n*****\n—WASHINGTON\nEgypt may receive U. S. sup\nport in an imposed United Na\ntions peace attempt in which Is\nrael but not Egypt would be re\nquired to make concessions.\nPlans are already being discuss\ned for a U. S. offer of new jet\nfighter planes and other arms to\nEgypt. America is seeking to re\nplace the Soviet Union as\nEgypt’s supply source. Uni\nted States is motivated by fear\nj of further Russian penetration and the desire of the\n|U. S. oil lobby to inherit British economic and po\nlitical power in the Middle East.\nEuropean diplomats are pointing out here that\nNasser, the Communist-backed dictator of Egypt,\nwill keep raising his price on the diplomatic front.\nHe will ask first for a diminished and then for an\nexterminated Israel. He will go along with the\nUnited Nations only so far as the UN supports\nhis ends. He has no intention of allowing Israel to\nhave a respite from fedayeen activities or passage\nthrough either the Suez Canal or the Gulf of\nAkaba.\nThe State Department has gone to great lengths\nin seeking to please Nasser. U. S. officials, for\nexample, sought to minimize and debunk reports\nof Egypt’s persecution of Jews.\nEgypt is dangling before America the tempting\nprize of increased prestige in the Arab-Asian world\nand the chance to assume influence lost by Britain\nand France. Nasser will make the United States\npay whatever he can extract. He is encouraged by\nJACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1956\nAgainst Discrimination\nA warning that the American way of life is on trial and that\n"manifestations of undemocratic human relations in the United\nStates" are jeopardizing the country\'s prestige abroad, was issued\nin New England this week by a Southern educator. Professor William\nVan Til of the George Peabody College, Nashville, Tennessee.\nPointing out that the "uncom\nmitted neutrals, the Asians and\nthe Africans, judge the United\nStates by our race relations,”\nProfessor Van Til called for a\nstrengthened program of inter\ncultural education to help win\n“the fight for better human rela\ntions” in this country.\nMr. Van Til was the keynote\nspeaker at the first New England\nConference on Human Relations\nEducation which was held at the\nOceanside Hotel, Magnolia, Mass.\nThe meeting, attended by 150 edu\ncators from 50 New England com\nmunities, was sponsored by the\nAnti-Defamation League of B\'nai\nB\'rith, Tufts Civic Education Cen\nter and the Commissioners of\nEducation in New England. The\nMassachusetts Committee of Cath\nolics, Protestants and Jews gave\nTufts Center a grant to aid in\nholding the Conference.\nEducators attending the Confer\nence urged the Anti-Defamation\nLeague to undertake similar con\nferences in each of the six New\nEngland states, expressing a great\nneed for instituting human rela-\nall-out U. S. support last month which actually\nsaved him from downfall.\nIsrael is urging the United Nations not to allow\na return to conditions that caused the last explo\nsion. Will the UN restore Egypt’s anti-Israel block\nade and return the murder gangs to the Gaza\nStrip? Or will the UN examine the underlying\ncauses of tension and enforce its own existing reso\nlutions calling for lifting of Egypt’s blockades\nagainst Israel?\nThe UN role will largely depend on the U. S.\nattitude. In early November the U. S. asked for\ntreatment of the basic ills. But the State Depart\nment retreated from that position to avoid dis\npleasing Nasser.\nVice President Nixon’s recent foreign policy\nstatement held that the sovereignty of Middle\nEastern states must be guaranteed, that there must\nbe a “just solution” of disputes among them, and\nthere must be “generous aid in solving their very\nreal economic problems, so that their people may\nrise from the depths of poverty and disease.” Israel\nis concerned lest the road the U. S. takes toward\nthese goals leads to one-sided support of Nasser\nagainst Israel.\nDoes the replacement of Herbert Hoover, Jr. as\nUndersecretary of State by Christian A. Herter\nhave special significance? Herter, retiring Gover\nnor of Massachusetts, may be more objective on the\nArab-Israel dispute. In 1949 the pro-Arab propa\nganda organization “H.E.L.P.,” predecessor of the\n“American Friends of the Middle East,” came\nunder fire from Herter.\nHe resigned as vice-chairman, charging that\n“H.E.L.P.” was “made up in large part of persons\nwho publicly took a position against the creation\nof an independent Israel.” He said “it has long\n(Continued on Page 5)\nSoutherner Warns\ntions programs in the school cur\nriculum.\nJoseph Kaplan, chairman of the\nNew England Regional Board of\nADL, said that the week-end\nmeeting, whose theme was \'The\nRole of the Schools in Human\nRelations Education," was a tre\nmendous success and opened up a\nnew approach to the problems of\nhuman relations in New England.\nAnother keynote speaker was\nProfessor Samuel A. Stouffer, di\nrector of the Laboratory of Social\nRelations at Harvard University.\nThe educators also heard three\npresentations on the subject.,\n“Intergroup Relations in New\'\nEngland—Highlights and Shad\nows.” The speakers were Mrs.\nMildred H. Mahoney, chairman of\nthe Massachusetts Commission\nAgainst Discrimination; Professor\nFrank L. Sweetser of Boston Uni\nversity; and Professor Bernard W.\nHarleston of Tufts University.\nSubjects discussed by the par\niicipanis were "The Nature of\nPrejudice," "Implications of Popu\nlation Movement." and "Manifes\ntations of Discrimination."\nMiss Gertrude Noar of New\nYork, national director of the\nADL’s Education Department, ad\ndressed the closing session along\nwith Tufts Civic Education Center\nco-directors Dean Henry W. Hol\nmes and Professor John J. Ma\nhoney.\nEban Warns Against\n"Tragic Folly" of\nRestoring Egyptian\nStatus QUO\nNEW YORK, (JTA) Ambas\nsador Abba Eban of Israel warned\nthat it would be “tragic folly” if\nEgyptian belligerency, by land or\nsea, were restored to Sinai, Gaza,\nthe Gulf of Akaba or the Suez\nCanal.”\nThe Ambassador, describing\nworld reaction to Israel’s efforts\nin behalf of Middle East peace,\ndeclared that his nation “has\nnever known a deeper surge of\nsympathy” than that now being\nmanifested by the people of the\nfree world.\nEban was the principal speaker\nat the second performance of the\nsixth annual Chanukah Festival\nfor Israel sponsored by Israel\nBonds at Madison Square Garden.\nFor the second time within a four\nday period a capacity audience of\nmore than 18,000 purchasers of\nIsrael Bonds participated in the\ncelebration to express their sup\nport for the young Middle East\nnation.\n$3.00 A YEAR'},

Barbara is\nfinishing up at Wellesley this\nyear and her husband is in\nthp Harvard Business School.\nFor the McElroys, of\ncourse, the Thanksgiving cel\nebration will be a prelude to\nSaturday’s Army and Navy\ngame. Joining the defense\nchief and his wife for the an\nnual service classic will be\nold friends from Cincinnati,\nMr and Mrs. Mark Upson,\nwho are due to arrive here\nFriday.\nReunion in Philadelphia\nThe Attorney General and\nMrs. William P. Rogers will\nfollow an old family custom\nby spending Thanksgiving\nDay with the latter\'s mother,\nMrs. S. M. Langston, near\nPhiladelphia.\nJeff and Doug, 14 and 12\nrespectively, will go up with\ntheir parents: Dale, their\nonly daughter, will come\ndown from Cornell, and Tony\nwill come from M. I. T.\nwhere he\'s a freshman stu\ndent this year.\nAfter Thanksgiving Day.\nthe family plans are subject\nto change. /\n“Tony may want to come\nto Washington on Friday\nand, if he does, I’ll probably\ncome back with him," Mrs.\nRogers speculated. ‘‘ln that\ncase, I don\'t expect I’ll get\nto the Army-Navy game.”\nThe holiday plans are on\nan even more tentative basis\nfor Interior Secretary Fred\nSeaton\'s family.\nMr. Seaton is still cam\npaigning for the G. O. P. in\nAlaska where the election will\nbe held on Tuesday. He\nwants to hear the returns\nbefore he starts back home,\nhis wife explained, so he\nprobably will be traveling\nmost of Thanksgiving Day.\nAs of now, Thanksgiving\n■inner will be postponed to\nFriday, she added.\n■— RALEIGH HABERDASHER, WASHINGTON AND CHEVY CHASE\nI > * » .\n[ * * , * * i i ■- * \'\ns* • • * ■ l ■ - »\n!- ■ - , !\nreturn of this enchant-\n0 T| V So bentilifully curved—\n-0 ThA p*.

A\nyear ago she went to Canada\nto be with Barbara and her\nsecond baby, so Beverly pre\npared the family’s Thanks\ngiving dinner, she recalled.\nThanksgiving will be un\nusually quiet this year for\nSecretary of the Treasury\nand Mrs. Robert B. Anderson,\nwho expect to spend the day\nhere without their sons. Dick\nand Jerry are both at Har\nvard—the former in graduate\nschool—and decided against\ncoming to Washington be\ncause they have such a short\nholiday.\nSince the Secretary doesn’t\nfeel he can take enough time\nto go to their home in Green\nwich, Conn., the Andersons\nare postponing a family re\nunion until Christmas.\nJoining them for Thanks\ngiving, however, will be two\nlong-time Texas friends.

C.\nA June wedding is planned.\nFOR HOUSE OF MERCY\nPhantom Dinner\nI\nIs Under Way\nThe annual Phantom Din\nner to raise funds for the\nHouse of Mercy is Washing\nton\'s longest “party’’ and is\nnow underway.\nEach year the Ladies Board\nof the House of Mercy in\nvites everyone to “dinner."\nNo food is served—the\n“party" is nowhere and\neverywhere and lasts through\nthe month of February.\nIn this way the dinner\nwhich in reality doesn\'t ex\nist, is pure profit for the\nhome for unwed mothers.\nTickets to the phantom event\nare $5 or as much as a person\nwants to give.\nLast year, the 80 year old\nHouse of Mercy sheltered\n126 unwed mothers (most\nof them 15 to 17 years old)\nand their babies. Some of the\njunior high school students\ncontinue their studies under\nAsk DOROTHY\nDRAPER\nThe Most Ordinary Things\nCan Inspire Color Scheme\nGlancing up between the\nmaze of city skyscrapers the\nother day I saw the clearest\nstrip of blue sky I have seen\nin a long while. For some\nreason it reminded me of a\nvacation I had spent in Nas\nsau one winter. I had met\nthe Bishop of the Bahamas\nat a luncheon and he had\ninvited me to see the bishop’s\nhouse.\nI was so Impressed with\nwhat he had done to the sim\nple room which served as a\nchapel. He had ripped out the\nugly brown tiles and substi\ntuted 12-inch black and white\nones, and had whitewashed\nthe walls and ceiling a fresh\nfrosty white.\nThe altar, a plain table,\nwas covered with stiffly\nstarched white linen, and\nover it was a tiny canopy of\nsky-blue. The recessed win\ndows had a friendly sky-blue\ntrim. Tropical plants with\nshiny green leaves stood at\nattention in each corner of\nthe room. The mahogany\nbacked benches were dotted\nwith pillows of sky-blue duck.\nThink of a room in your\nhouse with white walls and\nceiling, bold black and white\nsquares on the floor, with\nthe home’s educational pro- -\ngram.\nThe House of Mercy is not\nan adoption agency itself,\nhowever, staff members of\nthe home have worked with\nsome 25 adoptive agencies to\narrange placement of babies.\n"A few of the girls with\ngood jobs sometimes manage\nto keep their babies,” says\nMiss Irma E. Ruff, director\nof the home.\nConcern of the girls for\neach other is “a remarkable\nand constant attitude,” adds\nMiss Ruff.\nThe House of Mercy is\nnon-sectarian, and girls of 11\ndifferent religious affiliations\nwere helped at the home in\n1961. Under the auspices of\nthe Episcopal Church, Bishop\nAngus Dun is president of\nthe Board of Trustees.\nChapel services are held\neach day at the home and\no\nsky - blue slipcovers, white\ncurtains with a design in em\nerald green and sky-blue at\nthe windows, and the sun\nshining through, dappling\nthe black and white floor\nwith dancing yellow speckles.\nThat’s what that one strip\nof blue sky reminded me of,\nso you can see how easy it\nis to think up a color scheme!\nV. E. C. asks:\nOur bathroom has oat\nmeal colored ceramic tile\nwith pale yellow trim and\nmint green walls. The fix\ntures are white. Shower cur\ntain has white background\nwith orange, yellow and\ngreen floral design. I’ve been\nusing white towels with gold\nmonogram, and also yellow\ntowels, but, somehow the\nroom seems to lack some\nthing. I am quite unhappy\nwith its present effect. Have\nyou any ideas as to how it\ncould be ‘perked’ up?”\nDear V. E. C.:\nLet’s change the wall color\nfirst. Give it a new coat of\nmandarin orange. Put your\nwhite and gold towels away\nfor awhile and introduce\nsome orange and empire\ngreen ones as “perker up\npers.”\nSUNDAY STAR\nVYashington, O, C., February 4,1962\nthe Chaplain, the Rev.

Tell model\nNo. 9,1 love Lucl." The wire,\naddressed to Mrs. Clifford\nDavis, president of the Con\ngressional Club, was signed\n"Lady Bird." Mrs. Lyndon B.\nJohnson was honorary chair\nman of the event.\nThe Vice President’s stay\nat-home daughter was one of\n19 famous daughters of\nSenators, Representatives\nand cabinet members who\nstarred in a show which\nspotlighted POISE Magazine,\nTHE EVENING STAR\nWashington, D. C.\nFriday, September 13, 1963\nBY ELEN I\nThe Star’s rotogravure sup\nplement beamed to young\nwomen between 15 and 25.\nIt was the first time a\nnumber of the girls ever had\nbeen on a runway. Said Lucl\nBaines Johnson, 16, who has\nlost 26 pounds and gone\nfrom a size, 11 to a 5, "I once\nmodeled when I was young\nbut I’ve forgotten just how\nold I was or where.”\nThere were a couple of\n"sister acts” in the show\nstaged by Mrs. Emily Keech,\nfashion co-ordinator for the\nHecht Co. Susan and Jeanne\nCelebrezze, daughters of the\nSecretary of Health, Educa\ntion and Welfare; and Nancy\nand Jane-Ann Broyhill,\ndaughters of Representative\nand Mrs. Joel T. Broyhill of\nVirginia, pivoted and turned\nvery professionally on the\noutdoor fashion runway.\nActor Is Guest\nYesterday\'s surprise guest\nwas movie actor George\nHamilton who had just ar\nrived from England after\ncompleting the Carl Foreman\nfilm, “The Victors.” The\ndark, handsome young man\nsigned autographs and got a\nlaugh when he noted that he\nand POISE had similar aims\n—appealing to young women.\nAlthough a number of the\nfall and winter fashions\nlooked and undoubtedly were\nhot to wear under a broiling\nsun on the terrace, they were\nscanned with interest by the\naudience for future inclusion\nin their back-to-school ward\nrobes.\nThey seemed to love the\nshiny black boots worn with\nstretch ski pants and the\nfrankly phony fur coats and\njackets. A black-and-white\nprinted pile at-home, full\nlength skirt with a sleeveless\noverblouse and a black turtle\nneck sweater worn by Nancy\nBroyhill drew a lot of ap\nplause, as did her lung plaid\nskirt, vest and white oxford\nblouse. Apparently you’re\nnever too young to dream\nabout looking glamorous at\nhome.\nMrs. Alice Thompson,\neditor-in-chief of POISE, in\nher greeting to the group\nsaid she felt there need be no\nbarrier between the different\ngenerations. “This show\nproves that mothers and\ndaughters can have a com\nmon meeting ground” when\nit comes to sharing knowl\nedge about fashion, beauty\nand poise, she noted.\nOther Models\nAmong the models who\nwere announced by the Hecht\nCo.’s fashion co-ordinator as\n“The First Young Ladies of\nOur Land” were Mary\nFrances Albert, Leslie Arends,\nBarbara Avery, Corinne\nBoggs, Bonnie Byrnjs, Tolise\nGathings, Alicia Lee Grant,\nSallle Lankford, Ann Mat\nthews, Ellen McCarthy, Susan\nRogers, Jill Teague, Martha\nWeaver and Phyllis Vanik.\nEach girl\'s appearance was\nmarked with background\nmusic identified with her\nState.\nCo-chairmen for the 3-to-5\np.m. event were Mrs. George\nGrant, wife of the Alabama\nRepresentative, and Mrs.\nJohn W.

News deadline 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.\nVol - 24 Thursday, December 3 r 1959 No, 18\nCouncil Considers Teenagers Ask Council\nCourt Parking Law For Extra Dance Space\nThe city council at its special\nmeeting on Monday, November 30,\nbegan informal consideraton of a\nproposed new ordinance prepared\nby city manager Charles McDon\nald which attempts again to solve\nthe problem of regulating parking\nin the service courts of GHI resi\ndents.\nThe new ordinance would permit\nthe city manager to assign to each\nGHI unit served toy a court park\ning area one lined parking space\nwithout the payment of a fee.\nHowever, in those courts where\nthere are more units than parking\nstalls the city manager would as\nsign some units to spaces in ad\njacent courts or in public parking\nareas.\nThe new law would also provide\nthat in courts with limited parking\narea, no spaces would be assigned\nto those units where the resident\nis on record as renting a GHI ga\nrage. In courts where there are\nextra spaces those stalls would be\nmarked for visitors and a six-hour\nparking limit set, although per\nmission could be obtained from\nthe city to use it for guests for\nlonger periods. These visitors’ spac\nes might also be used by court\nresidents with second cars, provid\ned no objection was raised by oth\ner residents.\nMcDonald emphasized that the\nparking space would be assigned\nto a unit and not to a car owner.\nThe unit would have this space\nwhether or not the owner posses\nsed a car.\nSeniority Basis\nCouncilman Dave Champion\nbrought out the point that all\ncourts would not be immediately\nassigned parking spaces upon\npassage of the ordinance but that\nthis would be done upon the re\nquest of the residents of the in\ndividual court. He also suggested\nthat some method, such as senior\nity of residence, be devised to de\ntermine which units in a crowded\ncourt be given parking space in\nsome other court or close to the\nunit.\nThis raised the problem of what\nwould happen if a senior court\nresident with a good parking spot\nshould sell his house. Would this\nautomatically go to the new owner\nor would it be reassigned to a more\nsenior resident? The city manager\nsaid that he would prefer not to\nhave to change parking assign\nments once they have been made.\nThe new ordinance calls for a\ntv/o dollar fine for parking in\nsomeone else’s space without the\nowner’s permission. If not paid\nwithin three days, the offender\nwould then be subject to a fine of\nbetween $5 and $25 or 30 days in\njail. The proposed ordinance has\nyet to be reviewed by the city so\nlicitor for legal accuracy before it\nis formally presented to the coun\ncil for approval.\nSTILL REMODELING\nBUT\nOPEN AS USUAL\ndreei be 1 1 Ten Pin Lane\nGR 4-4211\nA group of eight teenage girls,\nmembers of the senior youth cen\nter group, appeared before the spe\ncial meeting of the city council\non Monday, November 30;, to seek:\nextra recreation space for\' dances\nand other activities.\nMiss Mary Dean, spokesman for\nthe group, asked whether the eldl\npost office, now vacant, might be\nused for this purpose on Friday\nnights when there is often ne»\nyouth activity scheduled in the\ncommunity. The council pointed,\nout, however, that GCS (Cbr-opj,\nthe owner of the building; is pres\nently conducting negotiations to\nrent the space for commercial pur\nposes and that it: may shortly be\noccupied.\nMiss Dean said that what was\nparticularly needed was recreation\nspace during the coming; Christ\nmas holidays. The council agreed\nthat this was a reasonable request,\nand city manager Charles Mc-\nDonald indicated that he was cer\ntain that arrangements could he\nmade, probably for the use of the\nCenter School, for several nights\nduring this period.\nMayor Alan Kistler praised the\nyoung ladies for their initiative in\nbringing their problem t® the at\ntention of the council but noted,\nthat such matters should be usu\nally channeled to the council\nthrough the Youth Advisory Board\nand the city recreation director..\nWhere Are The Decks?\n“Pop” Bell,, the local warden at\nthe lake, has a problem. On No\nvember 7, there were 55 ducks at\nthe lake. On November 15, there\nwere forty ducks at the lake. Is\nthere anyone around Greenbelt -\nor the area, for that matter -\nthat would deliberately steal all\nthese ducks? The council voted\nsome time ago to purchase the feed\nfor the ducks, and Pop offered to\nfeed them every day. This has\nand is being taken care of as\nagreed.\nPop says he would like to re\ncommend to those responsible for\ntaking the missing ducks that they\nhad better not get caught. On\nthe other hand, Pop would like\nvery much to have the regular feed\naugmented and requests that resi\ndents save all their dry bread and\ntake it over to feed the ducks.\nDONOR\'S LUNCHEON\nThe Women’s Group of the Prin\nce Georges County Jewish Com\nmunity Center is having a Donor\nLuncheon on Sunday, December 6\nat 1:30 p.m. at the Villa Rosa\nRestaurant in Silver Spring.
