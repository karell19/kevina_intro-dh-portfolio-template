CLS-0161 - Introduction to Digital Humanities

Professor Saxton

Eileen Gardiner and Musto G. Ronald's two beginning chapters of their book titled "The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars" present as a small glimpse into the history and ethos of the Digital Humanities as a discipline of study, in the context, and also seperately from that, of the Humanities. This glimpse subjects the Digital Humanities to a focus that is particularly critical and necessary for its larger appreciation and development within the scientific community. 

The first chapter, the "Introduction to the Digital Humanities", serves to establish the Humanities as it has been established and developed throughout history, and how the notion of the Digital Humanities has grown from it. From reading this chapter, I remain questioning why the distinction between the Digital Humanities and the Humanities was, and continues to be, so important for some humanists to establish? What would be inherently different between these two disciplines that are grounded on the same principles that have governed humanist research and thinking for centuries? The most prominent difference that remains clear to me would be the presence and appreciation of computational methods in conducting humanist research. Perhaps I am not as acclimated into the processes involved in traditional humanist research to be able to comprehend the detriment from blurring the distinction between these two disciplines. As I continue to understand it, computational methods have been sought and employed by humanists to improve the efficiency and capacities of humanist research. 

I saw very little harm in this before reading the second chapter of this book, "The Organization of Humanities Research". I must concede that this chapter did help me note the problems with a complete and utter reliance on computational methods, which may detract from humanist analyses, or that may present problems that non-computational humanist practices have developed guards against when conducting and maintaining research. I do think the biggest issue with an overreliance on computational methods would be the possibility for a skewed understanding of evidence--a term this book uses to describe research data in the Humanities, which I liked--that forfeits the irreplacable human-to-human analysis that is paramount to traditional humanist research. However, I do not see why such computational analyses cannot exist adjacent to traditional human analsyes of evidence. I do see that conducting two seperate analyses on one piece of humanist evidence may have significant costs, however, I believe all forms of evidence should be allowed and able to receive multiple analyses. Would that not solidify our humanist understanding of it? Another problem that this chapter raised to my attention would be the lack of processes that exist to preserve and maintain work of the Digital Humanities. I think this should be a problem that humanists and computer scientists, however, can work to overcome together. I believe that our human dependency and engagement with technology will only become more established as time passes. I think this would pose many more problems for our ways of living beyond the preservation of Digital Humanities research. 

I do not think we should give up nor ignore the potential benefits that computational methods may be able to provide human civilization with. I think there is both good and bad to be derived from these methods, and I think that understanding and aiming to develop a mastery of them would serve us well.
