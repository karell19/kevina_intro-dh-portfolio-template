Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think” is an article that primarily seeks to reflect and consider the possibilities in research and innovation that advancements in computational technologies throughout history have offered.

Bush remarks that throughout history, we have a substantial amount of technological developments have been developed and utilized with the objective of extending our physical capacities beyond that which our biological bodies permit; He emphasizes that it is now time for us to begin focusing on expanding our “powers of the mind.” It is always interesting for me to think about how I have been born in a world wherein technology is an omnipresent and “absolute” aspect of our daily lives. I will never have the opportunity to experience life as it was before the advent of many technological and computational innovations, and so, it is truly impossible for me to truly and utterly fathom the extent to which technology has transformed our ways of life. This article was published in 1945, and so, it is astounding for me to have read the ways in which Bush recalls the development of ancient technologies into those technologies and innovations underway in Bush’s present day. As he described the development of image-capturing technologies, and began to explore the most up-to-date innovations posed by the cameras of the 1945, and how they were only at the cusp of exploring and furthering instantaneous image processing, I could only think about the thousands upon thousands of images I have on my phone. In many ways, my phone is a physical manifestation of ideas and predictions about what those in the 1940’s believed the future would hold. I was left wondering just how dramatically this technology could advance in the next 77 years—the same amount of time since Bush’s predictions?

I think, however, that Bush’s main point in this article resonated when he emphasized the unreasonable idea that, with the incomprehensible amount of research—whether historical or recent—that we now have easy access to, we should strictly adhere to traditional and ancient methods of conducting and engaging in research. Instead, Bush agrees that we should attempt to reap the greatest benefits technological advancements pose in the fields of research, so as to answer unanswered questions of the past, and to facilitate the conception of new ones—to be solved by newer technologies.

I thoroughly enjoyed engaging with these notions as posed and examined by Bush. I cannot imagine how I will comprehend the innovation that awaits our civilization in the coming years. I wonder if I will even be able to notice it pass me by? I hope that someday in the distant future I can look back at this reflection and reflect, as Bush did, on all the advancement that has taken place since.
