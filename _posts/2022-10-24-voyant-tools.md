## Reading Reflection on the Application of Voyant Tools on the "Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant" by Ulysses S. Grant.

Voyant Tools is a web-based project designed with the intention of facilitating and encouraging analyses of texts, particularly those within the field of the Humanities. Given the opportunity to tinker with this curious resource, I decided to apply it on the "Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant" by Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States who occupied a critical position during the American Civil War as the commanding general of the Union Army. 

Upon my first engagement with this tool, the feature that stood out to me most was this program's display of the most frequent words that appear in an input text. In regards to the possibilities this may offer in interpretive analyses, I believe it would permit researches a quick glance into the words that may provide the most insight into the author's method of writing, and relatedly, their intentions with producing the relevant text. My input of this text revealed that the words "general," "army," "enemy," "troops," and "time" were the most commonly emplaced words across this text. Without much background knowledge on this text and its author, these five terms immediately nurture assumptions that this text may heavily speak on issues pertinent to war. The word "time," however, would be an exception to this; It is difficult to tell where it would fit in the notion of war. A guess of mine would be that it may have to deal with Grant's concern with the length of the American Civil War, specifically, those casualties and damage a prolonged war might have on the American people.

It may be the case that this initial interpretation is entirely wrong, however, it does provide us with the ability to contextualize ourselves with the contents of a text before digesting it thoroughly. It made me begin to think about the relevance of these words both with respect and irrespectively to one another, and allowed me the opportunity to go into this text with a general idea of those topics and ideas most prevalent throughout it.
